# Generative-Feedback-Loops

## Overview

The "Generative Feedback Loops with LLMs" project explores the fascinating world of Language Models (LLMs) and their applications in generative feedback loops (not only using results from the database to answer a query, but saving the resulting generation back in the database for future reference.). This project aims to delve into the synergy between generative models and feedback mechanisms, creating a self-reinforcing loop that produces creative and evolving outputs.

## Motivation

Language Models have made significant advancements in recent years, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text. This project's motivation lies in exploring the potential of leveraging these models within a feedback loop. By harnessing the generated outputs as inputs to iteratively improve the model, the aim is to witness how the model's creativity and coherence evolve over time.

## Objectives

- Build a pipeline that integrates a state-of-the-art Language Model (e.g., GPT-4) with a feedback mechanism.
- Develop a mechanism to feed generated outputs back into the model for further refinement.
- Investigate the impact of different feedback strategies on the quality and creativity of generated text.
- Explore potential applications of generative feedback loops, such as creative writing, brainstorming, and artistic expression.

## Methods

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a diverse dataset to pre-train the Language Model on various writing styles and topics.
2. **Model Integration**: Integrate the pre-trained Language Model (LLM) into the project pipeline.
3. **Feedback Mechanism**: Design and implement a mechanism to provide generated outputs as feedback to the LLM.
4. **Iteration Loop**: Run the LLM with feedback through iterative loops to observe improvements and changes.
5. **Evaluation**: Develop metrics to assess the quality, coherence, and creativity of the generated text.
6. **Comparison**: Compare different feedback strategies and their impact on the LLM's performance.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- PyTorch or TensorFlow (for LLM)
- [Hugging Face Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) library
- Data collection tools (web scraping, APIs, etc.)
- Git for version control

## Results

The project aims to showcase the evolution of generated text quality and creativity as the feedback loop iterates. The results will be presented through various metrics, comparisons between different feedback strategies, and possibly creative outputs from the LLM.
